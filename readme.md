# gulp jekyll


# What

Have you ever wanted to compile your jekyll site with the power of gulp?

This is it!

## Why

By using gulp to compile your jekyll site in a task, you can run live reload or
other tasks before/after the jekyll site is built.

No more `jekyll serve --watch`

Plus, you can pick your own port number!
